# Spotify Playlist Analysis using Python
In this Project, I have applied different types of Machine Learning algorithms to a Spotify Playlist dataset.
Different types of analysis done in this Project are:
  1) Linear Regression Analysis: Linear regression is a supervised algorithm that predicts the value of unknown data by using another related and known data value. In this project for Linear Regression, I have split the dataset such that 70% would be used to train the model and the rest 30% would be used to test it.
  2) Logistic Regression Analysis:  Logistic regression is a supervised classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables.
  3) Cluster Analysis: Cluster analysis is an unsupervised learning algorithm, meaning that you don't know how many clusters exist in the data before running the model. 
  4) Factor Analysis: FA is an unsupervised data analysis algorithm used to search influential underlying factors or latent variables from a set of observed variables. It helps in data interpretations by reducing the number of variables. It extracts maximum common variance from all variables and puts them into a common score.
  5) Principal Component Analysis: PCA is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algortihm that is commonly used to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets. It works by reducing a large collection of variables into a smaller one that retains the majority of the information from the larger set.
